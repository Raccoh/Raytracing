# Raytracing
An attempt to implement modern raytracing techniques.

### Disclaimer
I do not claim ownership of any content in this project. Its sole purpose is replicating and learning modern raytracing techniques. There are parts that were simply copy-pasted from elsewhere for convenience.

Most importantly, I was inspired by Kevin Beason's [smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/). More credits will follow as I use them.
